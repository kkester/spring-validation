# spring-validation

### Overview

This PoC demonstrates the following architecture, design, and coding strategies:

1. Spring validation on POJOs provided as parameters to a Spring Service Bean
2. Standard Bean property validation
3. Custom Bean validation
4. Spring Boot Unit Test with Exception assertions
5. Leveraging Lombok
6. Using `reckon` for version management

### Building the App
Below is an example command that builds the application and creates the next semantic version
```
./gradlew build -Preckon.scope=major -Preckon.stage=final reckonTagCreate
```

Upon completion, run `git tag -l` and the tag created from the build should be displayed.
